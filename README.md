Telegram Reminder Bot:

The bot is written in Google's App Script and it's linked to a google sheet that serves as its database.

Sorry can't link the google sheet :( but the idea is pretty simple

The script is ran by the bot everyday between 12:00 - 1:30 AM CST and it's in the executable section of google sheets.

The telegram bot can be accessed by making a new bot and copying its ID and after that you can just you this template and you should be solid !
